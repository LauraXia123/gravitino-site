# Welcome to Apache Gravitino

Gravitino is a high-performance, geo-distributed, and federated metadata lake. It manages the metadata directly in different sources, types, and regions. It also provides users with unified metadata access for data and AI assets.

The Apache Gravitino website is being transferred to the ASF, to access an earlier version of the Gravitino documentation, please visit [Datastrato website](https://datastrato.ai/docs/).
